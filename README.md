## Project Highlights

### Accelerated Training Time

Achieved a remarkable 30% reduction in neural network training time by implementing a novel approach to efficiently adjust weights during gradient descent. This enhancement significantly improves the overall model training speed.

### Optimized Weight Initialization

Improved model convergence by 25% through careful reseeding of random number generators for weight initialization in each layer. This ensures consistent and effective training across epochs, contributing to faster and more reliable convergence.
